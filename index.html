        Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies as early as the 17th century, and in the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It eventually made its name across the globe, 
        and now is a staple in many international countries. Countries like India, England, and Australia are considered cricket powerhouses and consistently have great talent coming out of those areas.
