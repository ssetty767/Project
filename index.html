    <h1>Overview of Cricket <img src="images/cricketfield.jpeg" alt="tiger" width="300" height="150"></h1>
    <p>
        This website serves as a casual introduction to the sport of cricket. We'll go over the various aspects of the game, and showcase some great recent performances to take a look at if interested. 
        This page will also have a section focused on cricket's expansion into the US. Cricket has typicallly been an international sport, and is starting to make its way over to the US.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies as early as the 17th century, and in the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It eventually made its name across the globe, 
        and now is a staple in many international countries. Countries like India, England, and Australia are considered cricket powerhouses and consistently have great talent coming out of those areas.

        The game has three main formats:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Format</th><th>Length</th><th>Championship</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>T20 (20 Overs)</td><td>Typically around 3 hours.</td><td>T20 World Cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ODI (50 Overs)</td><td>Typically around 8-9 hours.</td><td>Cricket World Cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Test Match (5 Days Long)</td><td>Allocated for 5 days, can be shorter</td><td>Test Championship</td>
        </tr>
    </table>   
    <p>Cricket is played with two teams of 11, made up of batsmen, bowlers, and all rounders (players that can do both). Batsmen try to hit the ball and score as many runs as possible, and Bowlers try to get batsmen out and not give up runs.
        One team is typically sent out to bat or bowl first, and depending on the format above, they have an alloted amount of overs (each over is 6 balls) to score as many runs as they can. The bowling team is trying to restrict them to a low total, 
        in order for their batsmen to have an easy job. Once the first innings is over, the teams switch, and the batting team bowls while the bowling team bats. The bowlers are now trying to defend the total set by their team, and the batsmen are trying to chase it down.
