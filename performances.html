    <p>In this page, we will talk about notable performances from some of my favorite players. 
        As an Indian, my favorite players are from India, and we'll be featuring some of their performances.</p>
    <p>The first performance is from the IPL, which is a domestic league in India. 
        Two of the top batsmen in the world, Virat Kohli and AB De Villiers, both scored centuries, which is hard in the limited format. 
        To have two players score centuries in the same T20 game is extremely rare. Take a look at their performance.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The next performance is from arguably one of the best to play cricket all time. Sachin Tendulkar hits an incredible 163 (and doesn't get out) against a powerful New Zealand attack.
        You can see the level of skill in this innings.</p>

    <br>
    <p>
        The last one I want to point out is a performance by Yuvraj Singh. A bowler bowls an over, which is 6 balls. The max number of runs you can get off of one ball is 6 runs, if you hit it out of the field.
        Yuvraj manages to hit every ball out of the field for 36 runs off of the over.

    <br>
    <p>On the bowling side, here's a performance I really thought was impressive. You can see the pinpoint length and accuracy of the bowling, and this sort of performance was extremely rare.</p>
