    <h1>Fielding</h1>
    <p>Fielding can really make a difference for a side during a cricket match. It can save several runs, get batsmen out, and overall put more pressure on the other side.
        Here's a picture of the common fielding positions.
    </p>

    <p>As you can see, there's a variety of them. Different positions are meant for different things - the ones farther out are to prevent the boundary from happening, which is when the ball touches the edge of the field and the batting team gets 4 runs.
        The ones closer in are meant to stop the ball when it doesn't travel much, and get it back to the wicketkeeper (who stands behind the batsmen) for a possible run out. The ones closer in are usually the sharper fielders, as they have the reflexes to 
        catch the ball in case there is an opportunity.

    <p>Here are some great catches throughout the history of cricket to showcase some great fielding performances.</p>
