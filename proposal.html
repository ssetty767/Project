    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>I'd like to create a website for people to get an overview of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" target="_blank">cricket</a>. It's a very popular sport outside the US, but many in the US don't know it or understand how it works.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of friends that ask me how cricket works given they weren't exposed to it and this site could serve as a resource for people to understand the game.</p>
    <p>Target audience is people primarily in the US. International folks have pretty good exposure to cricket given it's spread, but in the US it hasn't caught on as much.</p>
    <p><strong>Content on each page</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Batting - similiar to baseball when you are trying to score runs</li>
        <li>Bowling - similiar to pitching in baseball</li>
        <li>Fielding</li>
        <li>Noteworthy performances</li>
        <li>Cricket in the US</li>
    </ul>
